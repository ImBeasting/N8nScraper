    "approach": "Modified load_files() to load ALL .ts files in actions/ directory recursively, not just .operation.ts and .resource.ts. Also enhanced to pass correct file paths for spread resolution. This provides 500% improvement for Discord (4\u219224 properties) and improvements for other action-based nodes. Full spread resolution within action files needs additional work.",
