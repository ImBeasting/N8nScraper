# Validation Summaries

This directory contains all quality audit reports generated by AI agents following the validation protocol in `ai_review_prompt.md`.

## Directory Purpose

- Keeps validation reports organized in one place
- Prevents clutter in the project root directory
- Easy to review historical audits
- Clear naming convention for easy identification

## File Naming Convention

```
VALIDATION_SUMMARY_<date>_<agent_name>.md
```

**Examples:**
- `VALIDATION_SUMMARY_2025-11-13_claude_code.md`
- `VALIDATION_SUMMARY_2025-11-13_gemini_cli.md`
- `VALIDATION_SUMMARY_2025-11-13_openai_codex.md`

## Special Reports

- **VERSIONED_NODE_FIXES_SUMMARY.md** - Comprehensive analysis of versioned node extraction patterns

## How to Create a Validation Summary

All AI agents should follow this process:

1. **Start the audit protocol:**
   ```
   Please conduct a comprehensive quality audit following the protocol in:
   /media/tyler/fastraid/Projects/n8n Node Scrapper/ai_review_prompt.md
   ```

2. **Complete all 7 phases** as specified in the protocol

3. **Create your summary report:**
   - Use the template provided in Phase 7 of the protocol
   - Save to: `validation_summaries/VALIDATION_SUMMARY_<date>_<your_agent>.md`
   - Include: statistics, findings, issues created, recommendations

4. **Regenerate reports:**
   ```bash
   python3 generate_reports.py
   ```

## Current Validation Reports

## Quality Standards

Each validation summary should include:
- ✅ Executive summary with quantified metrics
- ✅ List of issues found (with issue IDs)
- ✅ Pattern analysis across multiple nodes
- ✅ Sample quality distribution
- ✅ Verification of recent fixes
- ✅ Detailed findings by node
- ✅ Prioritized recommendations
