# Node: AI Transform

**Purpose.** Modify data based on instructions written in plain english


---

## Node Details

- **Icon:** `file:aitransform.svg`
- **Group:** `['transform']`
- **Inputs:** `['Main']`
- **Outputs:** `['Main']`


---

## UI Tips & Notices

**Expression Mode Tip:** When using expressions (switching from Fixed to Expression mode), n8n displays:

> Anything inside `{{ }}` is JavaScript. [Learn more](https://docs.n8n.io/code-examples/expressions/)

## Parameters

### Parameters

| Name | Field ID | Type | Default | Required | Description | Validation |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | ------- | :------: | ----------- | ---------- |
| Instructions | `instructions` | button |  | ✗ | Provide instructions on how you want to transform the data, then click 'Generate code'. Use dot notation to refer to nested fields (e.g. address.street). | e.g. Example: Merge 'firstname' and 'lastname' into a field 'details.name' and sort by 'email' |  |

---

## Common Expression Patterns

These expression patterns are commonly used with this node:

- `{{ $input.all().some(i => i.binary) }}`
- `={{ $input.all().some(i => i.binary) }}`

---

## Execution Settings

| Name | Field ID | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| Notes | `notes` | string |  | Optional note to save with the node |
| Display Note in Flow? | `notesInFlow` | boolean | False | If active, the note above will display in the flow as a subtitle |
| Always Output Data | `alwaysOutputData` | boolean | False | If active, will output a single, empty item when the output would have been empty. Use to prevent the workflow finishing on this node |
| Execute Once | `executeOnce` | boolean | False | If active, the node executes only once, with data from the first item it receives |
| Retry On Fail | `retryOnFail` | boolean | False | If active, the node tries to execute again when it fails |
| Max. Tries | `maxTries` | number | 3 | Number of times to attempt to execute the node before failing the execution *(Only visible when 'Retry On Fail' is enabled)* (min: 2, max: 5) |
| Wait Between Tries (ms) | `waitBetweenTries` | number | 1000 | How long to wait between each attempt (in milliseconds) *(Only visible when 'Retry On Fail' is enabled)* (min: 0, max: 5000) |
| On Error | `onError` | options | stopWorkflow | Action to take when the node execution fails |

**On Error Options:**

* **Stop Workflow** (`stopWorkflow`) — Halt execution and fail workflow
* **Continue** (`continueRegularOutput`) — Pass error message as item in regular output
* **Continue (using error output)** (`continueErrorOutput`) — Pass item to an extra `error` output
