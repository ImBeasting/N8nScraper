## Execution Settings

| Name | Field ID | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| Notes | `notes` | string |  | Optional note to save with the node |
| Display Note in Flow? | `notesInFlow` | boolean | False | If active, the note above will display in the flow as a subtitle |
| Always Output Data | `alwaysOutputData` | boolean | False | If active, will output a single, empty item when the output would have been empty. Use to prevent the workflow finishing on this node |
| Execute Once | `executeOnce` | boolean | False | If active, the node executes only once, with data from the first item it receives |
| Retry On Fail | `retryOnFail` | boolean | False | If active, the node tries to execute again when it fails |
| Max. Tries | `maxTries` | number | 3 | Number of times to attempt to execute the node before failing the execution *(Only visible when 'Retry On Fail' is enabled)* (min: 2, max: 5) |
| Wait Between Tries (ms) | `waitBetweenTries` | number | 1000 | How long to wait between each attempt (in milliseconds) *(Only visible when 'Retry On Fail' is enabled)* (min: 0, max: 5000) |
| On Error | `onError` | options | stopWorkflow | Action to take when the node execution fails |

**On Error Options:**

* **Stop Workflow** (`stopWorkflow`) — Halt execution and fail workflow
* **Continue** (`continueRegularOutput`) — Pass error message as item in regular output
* **Continue (using error output)** (`continueErrorOutput`) — Pass item to an extra `error` output
