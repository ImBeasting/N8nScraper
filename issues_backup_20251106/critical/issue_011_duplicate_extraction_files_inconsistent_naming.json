    "problem": "Extraction script creates duplicate files with inconsistent filename normalization, resulting in both lowercase_underscores and camelCase versions of the same node",
    "impact": "CRITICAL - 287 duplicate file groups (574 total files) wasting ~14MB disk space and creating confusion about which file has correct data",
    "root_cause": "Extraction script runs with inconsistent filename normalization between runs. Some extractions normalize to lowercase_with_underscores, others preserve camelCase from node names",
    "evidence": [
      "ciscoWebex: both ciscoWebex_data.json AND ciscowebex_data.json exist",
      "actionNetwork: both actionnetwork_data.json AND actionNetwork_data.json exist",
      "Total: 772 files instead of expected ~530 files",
      "Comparison shows ciscowebex_data.json has better quality (parsed defaults, outputs, group) vs ciscoWebex_data.json (raw strings)",
      "2025-11-07 manual spot-check: hubspot_data.json contains parsed defaults/outputs while HubSpot_data.json still has defaults serialized as a string and outputs stored as \"[NodeConnectionTypes.Main]\""
    ],
    "fix_approach": "1. Implement consistent filename normalization at start of extraction\n2. Use cleanup_duplicates.py to remove existing duplicates (keeping better quality version)\n3. Add deduplication check before file write to prevent future duplicates"
