    "created_at": "2025-11-13T19:10:00Z",

  "description": {
    "problem": "Multiple nodes (e.g., HubSpot, Slack) have a 'name' field case mismatch in their extracted 'node_info'. For HubSpot, the extracted 'name' is 'HubSpot' (PascalCase), but the source is 'hubspot' (camelCase). For Slack, the extracted 'name' is 'Slack' (PascalCase), but the source is 'slack' (camelCase).",
    "impact": "LOW - Minor inconsistency. While the nodes might still function, this discrepancy can lead to confusion or issues in systems that rely on exact name matching.",
    "root_cause": "The extractor might be performing some form of capitalization or transformation on the 'name' field during extraction, or it might be incorrectly inferring the name from 'displayName' in some cases.",
    "evidence": [
      "Source file: n8n/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Hubspot/Hubspot.node.ts",
      "Source snippet: name: 'hubspot'",
      "Extracted file: extracted_docs/hubspot_data.json",
      "Extracted node_info.name: 'HubSpot'",
      "Source file: n8n/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Slack/Slack.node.ts",
      "Source snippet: name: 'slack'",
      "Extracted file: extracted_docs/slack_data.json",
      "Extracted node_info.name: 'Slack'",
      "Command used to verify: jq '.node_info.name' extracted_docs/hubspot_data.json, jq '.node_info.name' extracted_docs/slack_data.json and manual comparison with source."
    ],
    "fix_approach": "1. Review the extraction logic for the 'name' field to ensure it accurately reflects the case used in the source definition. \n2. Ensure no unintended capitalization or transformation is applied. \n3. Test with: HubSpot, Slack nodes. \n4. Expected result: 'hubspot_data.json' should have 'name: 'hubspot'', and 'slack_data.json' should have 'name: 'slack''. \n5. Validation command: jq '.node_info.name' extracted_docs/hubspot_data.json should return 'hubspot', and jq '.node_info.name' extracted_docs/slack_data.json should return 'slack'."
