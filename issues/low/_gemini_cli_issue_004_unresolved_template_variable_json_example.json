  "description": {
    "problem": "The extracted documentation for the Execute Workflow Trigger node contains an unresolved template variable `${JSON_EXAMPLE}`.",
    "impact": "LOW - The documentation is slightly confusing, but the node is still usable.",
    "root_cause": "The extractor is not correctly resolving the `${JSON_EXAMPLE}` template variable, which is used in a notice. This is likely because the variable is not defined in the node's description or the extractor is not looking for it in the right place.",
    "evidence": [
      "The file `executeworkflowtrigger_documentation.md` contains the unresolved variable: `${JSON_EXAMPLE}_notice`"
    ],
    "fix_approach": "1. Investigate how the `${JSON_EXAMPLE}` variable is defined and used in the n8n source code.\n2. Modify the extractor to correctly resolve this variable and replace it with the appropriate content, which is likely a generic JSON object example.\n3. Test with the `executeworkflowtrigger` node."
