  "description": {
    "problem": "The extracted documentation for the HttpRequest node contains unresolved template variables `${urlParameterName}` and `${pagination.completeExpression.trim().slice(3, -2)}`.",
    "impact": "LOW - The documentation is slightly confusing, but the node is still usable.",
    "root_cause": "The extractor is not correctly resolving template variables used in the node's description and expressions. These variables should be replaced with their actual values during the extraction process.",
    "evidence": [
      "The file `httprequest_documentation.md` contains the unresolved variables: `${urlParameterName}` and `${pagination.completeExpression.trim().slice(3, -2)}`"
    ],
    "fix_approach": "1. Investigate how the `${urlParameterName}` and `${pagination.completeExpression}` variables are defined and used in the n8n source code for the HttpRequest node.\n2. Modify the extractor to correctly resolve these variables and replace them with their appropriate values.\n3. Test with the `httprequest` node."
