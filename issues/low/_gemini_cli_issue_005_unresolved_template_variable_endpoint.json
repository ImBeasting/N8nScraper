  "description": {
    "problem": "The extracted documentation for the E-goi node contains an unresolved template variable `${endpoint}`.",
    "impact": "LOW - The documentation is slightly confusing, but the node is still usable.",
    "root_cause": "The extractor is not correctly resolving the `${endpoint}` template variable, which is used in the API patterns section. This is likely because the variable is not defined in the node's description or the extractor is not looking for it in the right place.",
    "evidence": [
      "The file `egoi_documentation.md` contains the unresolved variable: `https://api.egoiapp.com${endpoint}`"
    ],
    "fix_approach": "1. Investigate how the `${endpoint}` variable is defined and used in the n8n source code for the E-goi node.\n2. Modify the extractor to correctly resolve this variable and replace it with the appropriate API endpoint path.\n3. Test with the `egoi` node."
