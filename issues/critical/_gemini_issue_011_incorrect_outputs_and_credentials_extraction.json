  "investigation_note": "Webhook credentials are defined as `credentialsProperty(this.authPropertyName)` (dynamic function call) and outputs as `={{(${configuredOutputs})($parameter)}}` (dynamic expression). The extractor correctly identified outputs as 'dynamic' but cannot extract credentials because they require runtime evaluation of TypeScript functions. This is a limitation of static analysis, not an extraction bug. Resolving would require executing TypeScript code or implementing function-call evaluation."
